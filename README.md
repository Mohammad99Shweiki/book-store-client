# BookStore frontend

This is frontend for my first bigger project. I started it as I was just placing my first steps in Angular and while creating it I got a job in Angular so I learned a lot but it was hard to implement many of this things with not best codebase so I decided to finish it as it is and move forward to apply knowledge at new projects.
